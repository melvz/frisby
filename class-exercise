## This class creates a new class of students.  The purpose of the class is to only TO HANDLE inputs of student data.  



class Student():

        def __init__(self, name, address, grade):
                self.name = name
                self.address = address
                self.grade = grade


## The actual input of student data is done when you declare variables a, b, and c.
a = Student("Student A", "QC", 80)
b = Student("Student B", "MAR", 99)
c = Student("STudent See", "KLK", 90)


## Here you declare a student list.

student_list = [a, b, c]



## Use a FOR loop to simply print the  students in student_list variable.
for student in student_list:
        print student.name


## Now here, you use a FOR LOOP to get the average GRADE.
average = 0

for student in student_list:
        average = average + student.grade

print average
